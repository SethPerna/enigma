OOP = 3
**Project is broken up logically and all modules have one responsibilty. All modules work flawlessly within the class that they are included. I used OOP to solve the CLI interaction and to satisfy all tests.**
Ruby Convention and Mechanics = 4
**All indentation and spacing is correct. No methods are any longer then they need to be. All naming convention is correct and all enumerables are the correct for the task at hand. Multiple hashes were created, implemented and called upon.**
Test Driven Development = 4
**All methods, modules and classes have been tested at unit and integration level. No edge cases exist, to my knowledge. All functionality are tested. All tests written before code. SimpleCov has 100% LOC.**
